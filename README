Nukleo Pageflip - A jQuery pageflip (page turning) plugin

This plugin is meant to be a replacement of similar Flash based plugins. It's not nearly as feature-rich as some of those are but it works on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and is, of course built using standard HTML, CSS and jQuery

It is meant to stay very simple and lacks a couple of basic features that will be added shortly (when I have time^^)

@NOTES
- Tested with jQuery 1.4.4 for the time being... should work on older versions but this needs to be tested.
- Optionnaly uses George Smith's easing plugin found at http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/

@TODO
- add direct page linking below the pageflip and in the title area
- add page zooming
- make the title zone completly dynamic
