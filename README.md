#Nukleo Pageflip
###A jQuery pageflip (page turning) plugin

This plugin is meant to be a (simple) replacement of similar Flash based plugins. It's not nearly as feature-rich as some of those are but it works on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and is, of course built using standard HTML, CSS and jQuery.


###NOTES
- Tested with jQuery 1.4.4 for the time being... should work on older versions but this needs to be tested.
- Optionnaly uses George Smith's easing plugin found at http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/


###TODO
- Add direct page linking in the title area
- Add page zooming (as of now handled by any lightbox plugin you choose)
- Make the title zone completly dynamic
- Make documentation and a dedicated webpage
